  "description": "The purpose of this project is to create a working version of a classic board game Battleship. The primary objective of this project is to reinforce the idea of testing and test driven development. I will start to deploy code and test that it is functional before I move on to further parts of the project. This will help me create projects that aren't as tightly coupled and to streamline the overall development process. By the end of it, I will have a functional webpage version of Battleship that a player can play against a computer.",
